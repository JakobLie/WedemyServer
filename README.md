(Backend repo). Clone of Udemy, an e-learning platform, built using Springboot + Vue 3 + Typescript. With CreditCard and
PayPal checkout (both powered by **Braintree Payments**). Uses Spring Security, Spring Session Redis & Server-Side
Cookies[^1] (see footnote) for auth,
_instead of_ stateless JWT Tokens. CSRF protection is enabled. For simplicity, both UserDetails and UserRole (enum) are
stored in the same table. Maximum 2 *concurrent* login sessions per user. You can easily customize these settings
in [SecurityConfig](src/main/java/com/davistiba/wedemyserver/config/SecurityConfig.java). By default, the app runs on
port 9000

## Frontend & Live Demo

Click to view [Frontend Repo](https://github.com/Longwater1234/WedemyClient) built using Vue 3 and Typescript.

## Requirements

- Java 11 or higher
- MySQL 8
- Redis Server 5.0+ (native / Cloud / Docker)
- [Google OAuth Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) (for Google Login)
- [Braintree Developer](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs) Account + API Keys. (for Payments)
- (OPTIONAL) Free PayPal Business Account.

### Environmental Variables

You MUST set these ENV variables on your System or Container before you launch this Springboot app. **üí°TIP**: During
dev/test, you can easily set them up within your IDE: In either Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, in the top toolbar, find
the **Run** menu > **Edit/Run Configuration** > **Environment** > **Environmental Variables**. Add (+) each key and its
value, then click **Apply**.

```bash
#below are for Google OAuth
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
#below are for Braintree Payments
BT_MERCHANT_ID=
BT_PUBLIC_KEY=
BT_PRIVATE_KEY=
#... in production, REMEMBER to set this:
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
```

## Important ‚ö†

Please examine the files [application.yml](src/main/resources/application.yml) (default),
and [application-prod.yml](src/main/resources/application-prod.yml) (meant for *production*). Replace all the necessary
Spring Application properties with yours. But for _sensitive_ info (like Passwords or API Keys), **DON'T PASTE THEM IN
THERE DIRECTLY**‚ùå . I suggest store them as Environmental Variables instead (see above), then either declare them
as `property.name = ${ENV_KEY_NAME}`, OR refer them directly in your source code as shown
in [BraintreeConfig](src/main/java/com/davistiba/wedemyserver/config/BraintreeConfig.java).

## Databases Used

### MySQL 8.0

This is the primary database. All DateTimes are stored and queried in UTC only. (**Hint: USE `java.time.Instant` as Type
for all Datetime fields**). Handle timezone conversion on your Frontend! For your convenience, I have included a
mysqldump file [data_wedemy.sql](src/main/resources/data_wedemy.sql) which contains sample data for testing. Also, here
is the [ERD diagram](src/main/resources/wedemy_erd.png) of this DB.

- CREATE new database called `wedemy` (any name is OK), with charset `utf8mb4`.
- To maintain consistent time-zone (UTC) with your Java app, ensure your JDBC connection URL has
  parameter `connectionTimeZone=UTC`. See example below. For native @Query's, use UTC_TIMESTAMP() or UTC_DATE().
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/wedemy?connectionTimeZone=UTC
   # OR, use this
   spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.time_zone=UTC
   ```

### Redis v5.0 (or higher)

This project uses Redis for 2 main tasks: Caching, and Storing login sessions. You can download latest Redis (macOS &
Linux) from https://redis.io/download. Windows users may download the latest native installer (.msi)
from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/tporadowski/redis/releases). Alternatively, you could run redis in Docker.
Another option, you could try Redis Cloud at: https://redis.com/try-free/. Remember to replace redis credentials
inside `application.yml` to match your running Redis instance.

| Tip üí° | Redis now has an OFFICIAL cross-platform desktop GUI client: RedisInsight. Download it free from [here](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/) |

## Payments Handling

All payments are securely handled by **Braintree Payments** (owned by PayPal), which also supports cards, Apple Pay,
GooglePay, Venmo and many other methods. This project has been configured with Credit-Card and PayPal Checkout only, in
SANDBOX (Dev) mode. Make sure you obtain a set of 3 API Keys from your own Braintree Dev Account and store them as ENV
variables: `BT_MERCHANT_ID`, `BT_PUBLIC_KEY` and `BT_PRIVATE_KEY`. For Braintree tutorials and examples, please check
their [official docs](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs).

## Deploying your App üöÄ

This App can be easily deployed within few minutes, straight from GitHub to your Cloud PaaS of choice. You can either
use the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) provided, or natively as a pure Java app. Popular PaaS for Java apps include:
Heroku, AWS ElasticBeanstalk, Google App Engine, Azure Web Apps. The following **may require** a Dockerfile: _Dokku,
Railway, Render.com, Fly.io_. Please note, you may also need a **separate** MySQL & Redis instance!

[^1]: In production, for Browser clients, ensure both your Backend and Frontend share the same ROOT domain (same-site
policy), and set `session.cookie.Secure=true` (strictly https), for Cookies to work properly. Learn more
at [WebDev](https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/). Alternatively, you may replace cookies with special Header
X-AUTH-TOKEN; see file SecurityConfig.java.
