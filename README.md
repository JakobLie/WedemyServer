# WedemyServer

Backend repo. A Springboot + Vue.js 3 clone of Udemy. Uses HttpSession (stored in Redis) + Cookies, for authentication.
Also contains CSRF protection.


## Requirements

- JDK 11+
- MySQL 8
- Redis Server (local or Cloud)
- [Google OAuth Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) (for _Sign In With Google_)
- Lombok-enabled IDE.

## Important ‚ö†

Please see the file `application.properties` inside `src/main/resources/` folder. Place all the necessary Spring
application values there.üö´ But for _super-secret_
info (like Passwords or API keys), **DON'T PASTE THEM IN THERE DIRECTLY** ‚ùå. I recommend store them
as [Environmental Variables](https://www.baeldung.com/properties-with-spring)
then simply pass them by reference as `property.value = ${ENV_KEY_NAME}`.

## Databases Used

### MySQL 8

This application uses MySQL 8 (InnoDB Engine) as main database. I have included a sample `.sql` file
in [src/main/resources/wedemy.sql](src/main/resources/wedemy.sql) which contains data for COURSES & LESSONS, and schema
for ALL required tables. Simply do the following to get started:

1. Make sure you have MySQL 8.x installed. (in terminal or CMD, enter: `mysql --version`)
2. Next, Install MySQL Workbench (version 8+) or use PhpMyAdmin instead (OPTIONAL).
3. CREATE a database called `wedemy`.
4. Then **Import** the file `wedemy.sql` into it.
5. Replace the values of `DB_HOST` `DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` inside _application.properties_ to match your
   database setup. That's it, DONE.

### Redis

This app uses Redis to store user sessions. I prefer managing sessions server-side rather than using Stateless JWTs. Did
you know Redis.com offers FREE lifetime trial for 1 Redis cloud instance? Check it out: https://redis.com/try-free/.
(**NOT SPONSORED**). Make sure you change the values inside `application.properties` to match your Redis local or cloud
deployment.
