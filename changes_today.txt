- managed to solve the problem (N * number of items) in wishlist SELECT queries.
- NOW only 1 query runs to return all items in Wishlist. Had to use `Course` return not `Wishlist`
- cleaned up my controllers with empty @PathVariable annotation.
- ki11ed 404 error for empty lists. Just return empty [] array
